This year I had the opportunity of organizing two Bhangra (a traditinal north Indian folk dance) dances
## Georgetown University
I helped setup a flash mob for the [International Political Economy Society 2014](https://ncgg.princeton.edu/IPES/program2014.php) Conference Dinner.
## Pan American Health Organization
I co-coreographed a performance for the PAHO got Talent.
